# ComputerVisionTUT2020
This course provides an introduction to computer vision including fundamentals of image formation &amp; filtering, feature detection &amp; matching, structure-from-motion &amp; image-based 3D modelling, motion estimation &amp; tracking, and object detection &amp; recognition. The course gives an overview of algorithms, models and methods, which are used in automatic analysis of visual data.

Tentative weekly topics are following:
- Week 1: Perspective camera and image filtering
- Week 2: Image classification and retrieval
- Week 3: Object class detection
- Week 4: Local features and least squares fitting
- Week 5: Planar transforms and tracking
- Week 6: Camera calibration and two-view stereo
- Week 7: Multi-view stereo and structure from motion
